    <b>What is pocketSteam?</b>
    <p>pocketSteam is a platform that allows people to talk to people in their steam friends on multiple devices, such as mobile phones and tablets.</p>

    <b>How can I use this?</b>
    <p>There will be a web app that should work on most platforms and device, and an android app that will be specifcly designed for ease of use on android phones.</p>

    <b>So how does it work</b>
    <p>Using the SteamRE library created by Voided, my server handles steam connections and relays important data back to your client (such as friends list and messages) and also recieves commands</p>

    <b>Are there any limits with this</b>
    <p>Only a certain amount of people will be able to use pocketSteam at a time due to limits on the server</p>

    <b>Is this useable yet</b>
    <p>Almost, there are still quite a few bugs and missing features, but you can use the web app to talk to your friends</p>

    <b>When will this be released?</b>
    <p>No ETA yet</p>

    <b>I don't want to give you my steam password</b>
    <p>Sorry, the only way to connect is with your username & password, a OpenID login isn't enough. But don't worry I don't log your password.</p>
